<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Christoph KÃ¼hnel. I am 28yo and live in Vienna.</p>

<p>My free time I mainly spend with playing video games. I used to be a professional gamer and built my own eSports organization in 2022.
  I love hanging out with my friends and getting to know new people.
</p>

<p>My biggest strength is my patience! I am a very loyal person and do everything to help the people I love.
  I love learning new things and would say that I am a very fast learner.
